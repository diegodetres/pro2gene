**prot2gene** is a computational tool to map protein sequences to genomic coordinates, providing a generalizable method for linking proteomic features to coding regions in the human genome.

prot2gene works by: 

1. Extracting protein-coding sequences from the human reference genome
2. Mapping translated protein features to coding genomic coordinates
3. Identifying features of interest in linked protein-to-gene dataset
